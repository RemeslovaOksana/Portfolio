## :wink:About me
Hi all. My name is Oksana. I am a beginner QA Engineer. And I'm a devoted bug hunter :smile:

I understand that my path as a QA Engineer has just begun, but I can say with confidence that I am very hardworking and my personal qualities will cover the lack of experience. I strive and do my best to become a very good QA engineer.
