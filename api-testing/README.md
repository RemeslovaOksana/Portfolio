3. [Test project](http://tasque.lol/index.html)

Task:
- Explore the Swagger test project (http://tasque.lol/index.html)
- See what controllers and models are available
- Come up with a chain of questions (minimum 12 questions) and a brief description of how they are related. Let it be an interesting chain.
- Submit requests using swagger to test how they work before adding them to the thread.
- Inherit queries you've come up with in Postman
- In the collection, build your query chain with Swagger with some tests. Use environment variables to store data such as assess token and id across requests.
